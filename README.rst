==========
Rust Quire
==========

The ``rust-quire`` is a Rust_ port for quire_ configuration parsing library.
It also contains YAML_ parser (however, it tuned for configuration parsing
rather than generic YAML parser, e.g. it assumes YAML always fits memory).

Status: Alpha. Use with care. No backwards compatibility guaranteed
